# 🌦️ Commuter Weather Dashboard

The **Commuter Weather Dashboard** is a web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It helps commuters and students plan their day by comparing real-time weather between two locations — for example, _Home_ and _School_. The app uses data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and provides simple recommendations like “Carry an umbrella” or “Wear a jacket.”
